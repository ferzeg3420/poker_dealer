# Summary
This is a web game that consists of python for the backend using a framework called Py4web. It basically teaches players to rank texas hold'em hands. The front end was written using Vue.js. The database is sqlite but can be quickly and easily changed to something else using the Pydal (python database abstraction layer). Please refer to the py4web project:

# Dependencies
* py4web 

# Installation
To run this code, all you need to do is download py4web (please use the link above to read the instructions on how to download it) and put the code here inside the apps folder. You probably want to do that by using git clone. This program should run on windows and linux. However, I've only tested it on macos. The reason it might not run on other platforms is because some of some code that's not actually related to the program at hand. Hopefully, I will remove this in the future. For your reference, it's the bash commands (import sys to run the clear screen command) ran by the python scripts in services/dealer_game
